		<p>I am a University of Marii Sklodowska Curiee graduate, who is just starting the adventure with commercial programming. I was born in '92 so it makes me a bit older than young, still, I am happy about my life passage. Three years ago I discovered a perfect career path, which is programming - connection of borderless imagination, satisfying results and endless self development. Beginnings was tough, but through blood and tears &#9786;, sleepless nights (filled with bugs) and really hard work at University, where programming was one of the easiest subjects, I had finally polished the priceless skill of algorithmic thinking, what is, in my humble opinion, one of the most important programming skill.

	<p>Beside programming, I have few other hobbies, so if you like sailing, traveling, playing football, or have love to the cinematography & literature, we are on the same team.
